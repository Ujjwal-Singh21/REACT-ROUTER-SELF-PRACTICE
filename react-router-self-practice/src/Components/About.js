        Technology Essay? Technology is all around us, from the smartphones and
        smartwatches to solar-powered street lights and all-electric cars. So
        how do we define technology? Are there any criteria that can be used to
        define the term “technology?” Can fire discovered by a caveman hundreds
        of thousands of years ago be considered as technology? Defining
        Technology Technology is born with the accomplishment of scientific
        progress and breakthroughs. However, the exact definition of technology
        varies according to context. Technology can be defined as the
        application of scientific knowledge to change and manipulate the human
        environment. Technology can also be defined as the branch of knowledge
        that caters to the creation and use of technical means and their
        relationship with society and environment, using engineering, applied
        and pure science. The sum of ways in which social groups provide
        themselves with material objects of their civilization. History of
        Technology The term technology is derived from the ancient Greek words
        “techne” and “logos”, which translates to “art, craft” and “word,
        speech” respectively. The term was used for the first time in the 17th
        century, and it was denoted to mean “a discussion of the applied arts”.
        However, with the industrial movement beginning in the 20th century, the
        term “technology” was used to represent a range of processes and
        techniques, in addition to machinery and tools. Over time, the term was
        used to associate scientific progress and breakthroughs in various
        disciplines. Technological Advancements The Renaissance, which occurred
        from the 14th to 17th centuries in Europe, marked a surge of interest in
        literature, arts and science. Most of today’s fundamental principles and
        the basis for many inventions were established during that time. For
        instance, renowned scientists, astronomers and inventors such as
        Leonardo da Vinci, Nicolaus Copernicus, Rene Descartes, Blaise Pascal,
        all lived during this time period. These individuals contributed many
        principles, theories and ideas that would become the basis for all the
        things we have in our world today. The next big leap in technological
        advancement came during the Industrial Revolution, which began in the
        1760s. This movement gave birth to many inventions such as the steam
        engine, the Spinning Jenny, the power loom and the electrical telegraph.
        When the world plunged into the two world wars, technological progress
        skyrocketed. This is because if any national had technological
        superiority, it could mean the difference between life and death. World
        War II, in particular, spawned countless innovations and inventions. The
        most significant inventions include the jet engine, synthetic rubber,
        radar, helicopters and penicillin. Pros and Cons of Technology
        Technology is a boon for many of us by making our lives easier. Saves
        time Enable instant communication and interaction Improves quality of
        life Helps to ensure safety Easy access to information/ products or
        services Though technology has changed our lives for the better, there
        are many negative implications. Causes addiction Increases pollution

        about Technology 250 Words in English A Short Essay on Technology will
        be helpful for students in classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Technology
        Essay Introduction Technology, in its most basic sense, refers to the
        use of scientific knowledge to create, monitor and design tools and
        pieces of equipment, which are in turn used to make life easier for
        people. Is Technology a Double-Edged Sword? Some people may argue that
        technology can become detrimental over time. This is supported by the
        fact that our technology has drastically changed the earth. Most
        technological wastes do not decompose and end up contaminating the soil
        or water around them. Other technological inventions, such as diesel
        engines, coal-powered engines pump out large quantities of greenhouse
        gases. As a result, the ice caps are melting and the sea levels are
        rising. However, the inventors did not foresee the catastrophic
        consequences of their inventions. Greener Future We can still make a
        difference though- by promoting renewable and eco-friendly technology.
        Electric cars are the future in a world where oil and natural gas is
        nearly depleted. Solar-powered homes can be sustainable and reduce the
        burden on the power grid. Nuclear energy is far more feasible, economic
        and cleaner when compared to coal-powered plants. Such technologies may
        be the only way our planet does not become irreversibly damaged.
        Conclusion on Technology Essay Technology is one of the greatest tools
        for mankind, however, it has the potential to be misused. Technology can
        also cause some jobs to become obsolete, causing unemployment. Moreover,
        current technology needs to focus on being more eco-friendly and
        minimize their carbon footprints. This is the only way to ensure that
        technology does not result in the destruction of our natural resources
        and eventually, our planet. 10 Lines Essay on Technology 100 Words

        Sustainable Development To give you an idea on the way to deliver a
        well-written essay, we have curated a sample on sustainable development
        below: In the past 20 years, the overall population in industrialized
        countries has been boosted to somewhere around 28%. These countries are
        facing many problems such as environmental degradation and
        over-dependence on non-renewable sources of energy, resulting in a
        decline in the standards of living. Sustainable development aims to
        facilitate growth that aligns with the present needs without
        compromising with the availability of resources for future generations.
        Sustainability is all about long term preservation of energy and
        resources rather than consuming them incessantly for satiating
        short-term needs. In the process of urbanization, industries are
        degrading the environment with their continuous use of natural
        resources. Sustainable development is all about creating new technology,
        companies and environment, without causing harm to the environment.
        Human survival has been brought under threat due to environmental
        degradation due to increasing population, economic development and
        deforestation. With the increase in vehicles and industries, greenhouse
        gases like carbon dioxide, methane are polluting the earth which has led
        to an escalation in the temperature. The greenhouse gases have resulted
        in the melting of ice caps leading to a rise in sea levels. The
        government and citizens of the country must take necessary important
        steps to bring sustainable development. Usage of eco-friendly technology
        like electric vehicles instead of petrol and diesel cars can be carried
        out. Following the 3-R Approach (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle),
        minimization of resource use, reusing poly bags or jute bags, instead of
        throwing them and recycling the materials goes a long way in achieving
        the goals of sustainability. The government and NGOs should also spread
        awareness and promote environmental education. Summing it up, the
        economic development which we have achieved so far has adopted various
        techniques that proved to be harmful to the environment. The compelling
        need is for sustainable development which aims at the development of the
        society without having a negative impact on the environment.
